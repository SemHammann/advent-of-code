# Advent of Code Bloem

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2023-2024.

_I'm trying to learn C so, most code won't be very optimized or pretty._

_There is a possibility that some day's don't work anymore because I updated the libraries._

## 2019

I started this year because of this year had some intcode puzzles, and I wanted to try them

## 2023

I started with the advent of code in 2023, and I started with coding in 2024. I practiced my C coding skills mostly with Advent of code.

_Before 2024 started, I had finished day 10. After this, I am first going to commit to 2024._

## 2024

This year is the first year I'm starting when it releases.

## Libraries

In the `./libraries/documatation` you can find the documentation for all my libraries.

_If there isn't a documentation for the library yet, I'm going to write it at a later date._

### Adventofcode (`advent of code`)

Contains standard functions used for Advent of code.

### Debug (`debug`)

In here there are some default functions, that all have an on\of switch.

### Queue (`queue`)
